# Weather Dataset Analysis

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing a weather dataset to uncover patterns and insights. The analysis includes temperature, humidity, visibility, wind speed, pressure, and weather conditions. The goal is to identify trends, relationships, and anomalies in the data to better understand weather behaviors.

## Features
- **Time-Based Analysis**: Trends and seasonal patterns in temperature and humidity.
- **Temperature Insights**: Extreme temperatures and their relationship with dew point.
- **Humidity Analysis**: Distribution of humidity and its correlation with temperature.
- **Visibility Patterns**: Impact of weather conditions on visibility.
- **Wind Speed Trends**: Variations in wind speed and their association with weather events.
- **Pressure Analysis**: Atmospheric pressure trends and their correlation with weather conditions.
- **Weather Conditions**: Frequency and co-occurrence of different weather events.

## Dataset
The dataset includes weather observations such as:
- Temperature
- Humidity
- Visibility
- Wind Speed
- Pressure
- Weather Conditions

## Tools and Libraries Used
- **Python**: Programming language for analysis.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and cleaning.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization.
- **NumPy**: Numerical computations.

## Key Visualizations
### Example Visualizations:
1. **Average Temperature by Hour**  
   A line plot showing how temperature changes throughout the day.
   
2. **Humidity vs. Temperature**  
   A scatter plot revealing the relationship between humidity and temperature.
   
3. **Wind Speed Distribution**  
   A histogram of wind speeds, highlighting extreme values.
   
4. **Weather Condition Frequency**  
   A bar chart displaying the occurrence of various weather conditions.

## Results

01. Seasonal temperature variations highlight distinct weather patterns.
02. High humidity often corresponds with lower visibility.
03. Wind speeds increase during specific weather conditions like storms.
04. Atmospheric pressure drops are closely associated with adverse weather events.

## Future Work

01. Incorporate machine learning models for weather prediction.
02. Analyze additional datasets for broader insights.
03. Explore real-time weather data integration.
